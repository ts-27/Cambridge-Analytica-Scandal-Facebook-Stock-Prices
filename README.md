# Cambridge-Analytica-Scandal-Facebook-Stock-Prices
This project analyzes the immediate impact of the Cambridge Analytica scandal (March 2018) on Facebook (Meta) stock prices, carried out entirely in R to demonstrate my ability to perform data analysis using the language. I collected weekly closing prices of Meta and several non-tech companies (Amazon, Disney, General Motors, PepsiCo, Goldman Sachs, McDonald’s, etc.) to act as control variables. The dataset was processed in R using the tseries package, and visualizations were created with ggplot2 to track changes around the event timeline.

To measure the causal effect, I applied Google’s CausalImpact library in R, which uses a Bayesian structural time-series model to estimate treatment effects. The results showed a short-term negative dip in Facebook’s stock price immediately after the scandal, followed by a sharp recovery and a small positive cumulative impact in the months after. This project highlights both my technical proficiency in R and my ability to apply econometric/statistical methods to real-world financial and business questions.
